# Documentation Output Restriction

When Cursor is discussing or explaining concepts (e.g., reasoning, planning, or answering questions), **it must not generate or save Markdown documentation files** (`.md`) unless explicitly requested.

1. **If the user is asking for an explanation, idea, plan, or concept discussion:**
   - Respond only within the conversation.
   - Do **not** create `.md` files or documentation outputs automatically.

2. **If the user explicitly asks for documentation output:**
   - Only then generate `.md` files.
   - Confirm the intended structure (README, guide, design doc, etc.) before writing.

3. **When generating docs intentionally:**
   - Ensure relevance — only summarize what’s finalized or confirmed.
   - Use clear headings, concise explanations, and consistent formatting.

4. **Prohibited behavior:**
   - Auto-writing or suggesting `.md` files for general chat, brainstorming, or planning.
   - Converting discussions or summaries into documentation without user request.

### Example

If discussing:
> “How should we structure our new API routes?”

✅ Respond inline with explanations and options.
❌ Do not auto-create `api-design.md` or similar files.

If the user says:
> “Write this up as a README.md”

✅ Then and only then create the `.md` document.
